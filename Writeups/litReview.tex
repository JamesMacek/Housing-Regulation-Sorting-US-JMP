\begin{abstract}
Introduces the topic, does a literature review, motivating evidence. The idea is to link the prevalence of single family homes and large lot sizes to the distribution of housing units within cities, and show that has welfare consequences in general equilibrium. Apply the logic to a general equilibrium model that covers the entire within-MSA geography in the Mainland United States. Use the former facts about the distribution to motivate the modeling of geography within MSA's (Commuting/Static Alonso-Muth-Mills) and the geography across MSA's (Rosen-Roback).
