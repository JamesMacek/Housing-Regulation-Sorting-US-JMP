This is the replication file for my Job Market Paper which can be found [here](https://jamesmacek.github.io/research/lswus).

This file runs mostly R code with some Stata called directly from R with the ```.Rproj``` file loaded in RStudio. 

It uses proprietary data, so this replication file cannot be currently run publicly. Providing public-safe and compressed data is a work in progress.

Please refer to the master project run file and package installer in the root folder. 

This project was run on R version ```4.3.2``` with all updated packages as of December 12, 2024.
